# Color Scheme

Color Scheme is one part of themes setting the color roles of the app. In this folder there are examples of color scheme generated by the Flutter SDK and by the package Flex Seed Scheme which the Flex Color Scheme package uses.

With Flex Seed Scheme I cover both the SDK variant way and the custom tones way.

Also note, in MD3 with the HCT color space we can no longer due the MD2 way of brand colors with taking the static color and doing a copyWith. 

Instead we need to use the MCU Blend.harmonized method to blend the brand color to the color role. The method will shift the hue but keep the chroma and tone the same.
