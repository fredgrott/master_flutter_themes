# MD3 Demo

So this is transforming the MD3 demo found in flutter samples to something more polished and professional including adding content container animation, nav icon animation, etc.

Its in two parts:
   -raw md3 demo is before incorporating Go Router
   -md3 demo gorouter is with go router incorporated.



## So why do this?

Because, I need to go further than the information that is out there. And so the best way is fully polished apps.
