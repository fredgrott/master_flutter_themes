It is usually easier to pair fonts of super families and Roboto is a super family. Roboto itself is a humanist neo-grotesque font.

Localized non western language scripts on Google devices use the Noto flex set of fonts. And Apple uses it own collection of non western fonts for language scripts on Apple devices of iOS and MacOS which is iPhone, iPad, Macs, AppleTV, etc.

Also, currently Google Sans found in Google apps is commerical and not open sourced.

Typically in Flutter apps we localize to avoid using the non western language scripts and choose the smaller font size of a combination of a sans font for body copy and serif for title copy. Also, typically switch to using variable fonts to reduce 
file sizes.

The list of super families that are variable fonts and their font axes are listed at this Google Fonts page:
