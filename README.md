# Master Flutter Themes

A better way to implement Flutter themes, rathter than creating 
the 22-plus component themes by hand.

Its kind of a small look at the engineering we have to do beyond the Flutter SDK to implement cool Material Design effects. In this case both supporting user-generated dynamic color along with better theme change animation.

I show the basic SDK theme approach with some Flex Seed Scheme help. Then I constrast that with the Flex Color Scheme approach where the component themes are generated by the Flex Color Scheme package.

I say engineering as when you deal with packages directly coupled to the Flutter SDK that improve the SDK there are some techniques that prevent major headaches. And those techniques are shown in this repository.

The packages covered are:
-material symbols
-dynamic color
-google fonts
-flex seed scheme
-flex color scheme
-hive




## Articles

AI has fed Reddit, Stackoverflow, Google Search, Bing Search, etc with not correct answers
in solving the problems you need to solve when developing Flutter apps. And to compicate 
things there are parts of the material design spec not implemented in the Flutter SDK and 
the Flutter GDE's are shying away from creating detailed articles on how to solve those
things including how to implement an adaptive and responsive scaffold that supports
canonical layouts.
