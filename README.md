A better way to implement Flutter themes, rathter than creating 
the 22-plus component themes by hand.

Its kind of a small look at the engineering we have to do beyond the Flutter SDK to implement cool Material Design effects. In this case both supporting user-generated dynamic color along with better theme change animation.

I show the basic SDK theme approach with some Flex Seed Scheme help. Then I constrast that with the Flex Color Scheme approach where the component themes are generated by the Flex Color Scheme package.

I say engineering as when you deal with packages directly coupled to the Flutter SDK that improve the SDK there are some techniques that prevent major headaches. And those techniques are shown in this repository.

The packages covered are:
-material symbols
-dynamic color
-google fonts
-flex seed scheme
-flex color scheme
-hive



## Master Material Design 3 By Reading My Substack

I am covering the challenge of implementing material design 3 in flutter when not everything is in the flutter SDK. For example, staggered animation as in this youtube reel video of it:
